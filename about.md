Hi! I'm from South Korea, and I currently live in the U.S.
I love climbing and attempting to solve hard problems.

My background is in computer science, but I'm quite invested in climbing at the moment.
I hope to bring my two favorite things together and build new things.

Thanks for reading my stuff, and I hope you enjoy them!
