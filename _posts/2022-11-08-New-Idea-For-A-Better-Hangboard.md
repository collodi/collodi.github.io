title: New Idea For A Better Hangboard

Okay, hear me out.
The better hangboard is not a hangboard at all.

Building a brand new hangboard for the reasons listed in the previous article is a dumb idea.
First of all, there are already plenty of hangboards out there.
Second of all, people have different preferences when it comes to hangboards.
And lastly, who wants to spend another $150 for a hangboard when you already have one? 

The better hangboard is in fact a weight scale.
Not just any weight scale, but one that can connect to your phone and tell you exactly how much you are pulling on the hangboard.

Most likely, you already use your phone as a timer when you hangboard.
Now, on top of the timer, your phone can tell you how much weight you are pulling in real time.
We can show load in absolute (in lbs) or relative (in percentage) terms.

The main advantage of this system is that no weights are needed for most people.
For example, if you wanna pull 120% of your weight, then you can pull 60% with one arm.
This is not only much lighter and safer than having weights on you, but also is much cheaper ($20 for a bluetooth weight scale).

The biggest disadvantage is that a lot of gyms have soft floors underneath the hangboard.
This will most likely affect the scale readings.
However, the percentage readings might still be somewhat useful.
We’ll have to test this with our prototype.

Another inconvenience is the maximum weight limit.
If you have super strong fingers and wanna pull more than 100% of your weight with one arm, then this system won’t work for you.

I will be using [this scale](https://a.co/d/5HuTov9) for my prototype, and will update when I have a working version.

Before I wrap up, I’d like to thank [Ryan Arment](https://www.abckidsboulder.com/team/ryan-arment/) for inspiring this idea and [OpenScale](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale) for facilitating the implementation.
