When I first started thinking about a better climbing brush, I immediately went to a motorized brush as most people would.
After a few days of thoughts, I came to the conclusion that we need a motorized poll brush.
Handheld brushing was already quite efficient and precise, while poll brushes were hard to handle, often missed spots, or just didn’t brush much chalk off.

I made my first handheld prototype in October of 2021 to see if motorized brushing could get more chalk off than manual brushing.
Even though the brush did the job well, I found that it was quite hard to resist the force of the rotating brush.
Originally, I thought this would affect the poll brush much more, but I went ahead and built a prototype anyway.

In the process, I was surprised to find that it was much easier to resist the force of a rotating brush because of the leverage you have with a long poll.
I can’t document the process in detail because I left my prototype at my old gym, but I will post the [video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wdwUZdjLdRaXYc7r6) I made right after the most recent iteration of my poll brush.


I hope to improve on the design in the future (including possibly adding a fan to blow away the excess chalk from the hold).
Below, I have a list of all the parts I used for my prototype.
