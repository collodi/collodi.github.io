title: A Better Hangboard
topic: Random Ideas
---

I’ve been using the Tension Block for a month or so now for training and rehab.
Overall, I like hangboards better as long as I have the space to hang them.

Let’s talk about some caveats I personally have with the Block.
First, I don’t get the same shoulder engagement I get from a hangboard.
In fact, the lifting position is quite uncomfortable with heavier weights no matter how I position the Block.
Second, you don’t get the same surface area on smaller edges because you can’t dig your fingers in like in a hangboard.
This is because the Block is not mounted on a fixed structure.
As a fan of the precision that the Block provides for weight loads, this is a big downside for me.
Third, there can’t be any slopers on a Block!

On the other hand, hangboards have some disadvantages over the Block.
First, your weight fluctuates.
So, even when you have the same extra weight on you, your fingers may be lifting different loads depending on the day.
Obviously, it’s not a big deal for everybody, but it is a downside.
Second, it’s hard to rehab on a hangboard because you would have to add so much counterweight.
Third, the counterweight set up is cumbersome.
Getting yourself attached to the counterweight is quite annoying, and it restricts your movement even during your rests.

If there is a way for us to precisely control the load in an easy way, the hangboard can be used in rehab and training with more efficiency.
And these hangboards would be much more approachable for lower level climbers as well.

To summarize, we need a finger training system that can simulate the position of our bodies as when we are climbing (shoulder engagement, finger digging in, etc.) and precisely control the weight for each pull without a cumbersome setup.

Here are some of my ideas to combine the advantages from hangboards and the Block.
1. Come up with an easy pulley + weight set up
2. A hangboard that measures the force you’re putting on
3. A hangboard that uses free weights as load instead of your body

Solution 1 uses traditional hangboards with an easier counterweight setup.
The new setup would ideally make < 100% hangs much more time-efficient.
For any > 100% hangs, you would still use the weight belt.
This loses the load precision because your weight could fluctuate.

Solution 2 has a load measurement on the hangboard.
This would provide a setup free < 100% hangs, but still with > 100%, the same problem exists.

Solution 3 is the most flexible solution of all.
One downside is that It just might not be feasible for > 100% hangs.

I do see a future for this project, but it just may not provide enough merit for enough people.
Most advanced climbers don’t use counterweights, so they don’t worry about the counterweight setup.
In fact, most of them will be doing deadhangs with extra weights.

Solution 3 could provide setup-free and > 100% deadhangs.
However, this would likely cost a lot more than the traditional setup.

As for lower level climbers who don’t really use traditional hangboards, they just might not care enough for hangboarding.
Most climbers do very well upto a certain level without hangboarding.
Also, these climbers should be working on their climbing skills rather than their finger strength.
