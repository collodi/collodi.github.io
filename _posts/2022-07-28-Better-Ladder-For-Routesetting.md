title: Better Ladder For Routesetting
topic: Random Ideas
---

I love routesetting, but there is a lot of tedious physical labor involved in it.
I’m mostly fine with them, but I just get annoyed when my thought process gets interrupted by these little things.
That’s why I like having a sorted bolt box, so I don’t have to spend much time getting the right size bolt.
When I have an idea for my boulder, I wanna put it up as fast as possible.

One of these little things that every setter has to do is dealing with the ladder.
So, as I love to spend my time thinking about useless things, I decided to spend some time on a better ladder for routesetting.

What I came up with so far is a ladder that is like a library ladder.
It can freely slide sideways on a rail after an initial setup, and can reach all heights of the wall with ease.

Unless it’s overhang.
The big difference between a bookshelf and a climbing wall is that a climbing wall has many different angles.
The ladder would serve well for 0 to slabby degrees.
As for overhangs, there would be more distance between the ladder and the wall the steeper it is.
For a roof, this ladder is almost useless.

Maybe this can be overcome by having another ladder attached to the original ladder.
You can picture 2 ladders standing to form the Greek letter lambda (&lambda;).
With this setup, the second ladder would be near parallel to the overhang.
Another solution is to just keep using the old ladders.

Keeping this giant caveat in your mind, we can talk about some advantages this ladder would provide.
First, the initial set up would be easy considering the climbing wall is structurally and functionally designed to attach things on it.
Second, with a little modification (and some money), you can motorize the ladder.
This would enable the routesetters to move the ladder while standing on it.
Third, with the right design, we can attach boxes that can hold all the tools and holds to the ladder itself.
The setter would never have to leave the ladder to grab more holds, bolts, screws, or bits.

As of now, the idea is pretty infeasible considering the cost.
Maybe this design can be used for rope setting in the place of a cherry picker.
This should cost less than a cherry picker, right?
