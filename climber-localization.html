title: Climber Localization
---

<p>
  Localization refers to the problem of pinpointing your location.
  The GPS is one of the most important technologies we have today.
  We can do thousands of different things by simply knowing where we are.
</p>

<p>
  A similar logic applies to climbing.
  I imagine climber localization will have dozens of applications in the future.
  This project deals with the localization technology itself.
</p>

<p>
  I will talk about different ways to localize climbers and different levels of localization.
  I will discuss my vision for the project in depth in the first article.
