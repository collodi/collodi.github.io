title: Random Ideas
---

<p>
  Here, I have a compilation of all my random ideas.
  Most of these wonâ€™t see the light of day because they are infeasible, not useful, or just flat out too random.
</p>

<p>
  Even though I love serious projects, coming up with seemingly the most random ideas is one of my favorite activities.
  Hopefully, some of these can bring inspiration for new ideas!
