  Climbing is an awesome sport.
  Climbing is also quite expensive.
  And I don’t mean this in just how much an individual needs to spend to start climbing, but I mean in terms of accessibility to climbing.
</p>

<p>
  There are far fewer climbing gyms in areas with less money.
  Even when there are climbing gyms in these areas, they are often lacking or just not as nice as modern climbing gyms go.
  This is a trend we see across the world, and it sucks.
</p>

<p>
  This is the reason I decided to publish my ideas on my website without patents or selling them.
  I understand this does not solve the major problems, but I believe this is a step towards the right direction.
</p>

<p>
  I don’t make any false claims.
  One day, I may decide to make profit off of an idea.
  However, my belief in equal access to climbing and safety will not change.
