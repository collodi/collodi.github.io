  Climbing is an awesome sport.
  Climbing can also be a quite exclusive and priviledged sport.
  This is a trend we see across the world, and it sucks.
</p>

<p>
  My goal is to lower these barriers to climbing using technology and innovative ideas.
  I want everybody to be able to share their love and experiences of climbing with people they care about.
