  Climbing is an awesome sport.
  Climbing can also be a quite exclusive and priviledged sport.
  This is a trend we see across the world, and it sucks.
</p>

<p>
  This is the reason I'm publishing my ideas on here instead of patenting or selling them.
  I understand this does not solve any major problems already out there, but I believe this is a step towards the right direction.
</p>

<p>
  I realize that this mindset may not be financially sustainable for me, and in the future, not all of my ideas may be free and open-source.
  However, I'm gonna try my best to do this as long as possible.
